Knowing where to dispose of materials, whether household items, construction equipment, yard waste, or other is a challenging task. With a large pool of facilities that accept only niche items, disposing of materials can be risky, time-consuming, and improperly performed. That's where Unload steps in -- to take the load off.

We developed Unload to serve people. Unload is an application that allows quick and definite access to the nearest and most suitable waste management facility for a users itemized needs. This is with no doubt a daunting task. In one of the largest counties in the U.S., Riverside serves a populous extremely diverse in socioeconomics, which brings to question: "How can we develop an app that serves everyone? Rich, poor, young, or old" But that doesn't stop Unload.

Unload makes use of Web, Mobile (iOS), and SMS technology to provide a solution to everyone, whether you have a smartphone, a supercomputer, laptop, flip phone, or tablet. Unload is tied together with powerful Natural Language Processing, state-of-the-art mapping tools, incredibly modern and efficient technology, and streamlined architecture all for the purpose of serving digestible data to the user -- hassle free.

Unload is Extensible: it makes use of open data sets and there is no reason that unload needs only to serve waste management. As NLP processes improve, Unload represents a new platform for dynamic solutions with streamlined interfaces. Functional: it's dead simple. Enter your item and allow GPS location (text a cross-intersection if you're using SMS). Find the best place to get rid of it. More time for you, less hassle for the county to sort through improperly disposed items. Unique: it is multifaceted like none other. Unload was designed at its core to be fair to ever user through text, app, or web.
